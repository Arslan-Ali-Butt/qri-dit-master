YHWP DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE YHWP PRODUCTS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE YHWP PRODUCTS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE YHWP PRODUCTS WILL BE CORRECTED. YHWP DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE YHWP PRODUCTS OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR OTHERWISE.

          %p{style:"text-transform: uppercase;"}
            %u LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
            \.

YHWP DOES NOT ENDORSE, WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH YHWP AND WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRDPARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.
