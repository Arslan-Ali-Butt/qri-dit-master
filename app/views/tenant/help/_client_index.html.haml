%p Welcome to QRIDit Home Watch Edition.
%p Your Homewatch Service Provider has invested in our software to provide you with a faster and more efficient customer experience. This short video is intended to familiarize you with what QRIDit Homewatch has to offer you, the client - our customer’s most valuable asset.
%p QRIDit Homewatch Edition has been created with both the client and the service provider in mind. Our easy to use and convenient client user portal enables you to keep track of all Homewatch-oriented work activity on your property as it happens and because reports are generated instantly, you can do away with the paper-work and start to access all of your documentation digitally.
%p The core functionality of QRIDit Homewatch Edition focuses upon QR Code technology. The QR Code is located upon a data card known as a Q. R. I. D. or QRID, which when printed out can be installed upon a pre-agreed location within your property by your Homewatch service provider. At a scheduled date and using an internet connected tablet or smartphone an assigned inspector will obtain a digital checklist by scanning the QR Code on the QRID. The checklist will consist of questions and instructions which when completed on the inspector’s handset will provide a comprehensive report about the condition and general status of your property. A completed report may also contain comments made and photographic evidence taken by the inspector concerning issues discovered during the inspection. In addition; QRIDit’s integrated time log and GPS technology will provide you with the inspector’s geo-location at the time of submission as well as an accurate record of the time that the inspector spent completing the report.
